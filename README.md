# Generalised Planck components

A starting point for defining a series of components for hyperspy to implement the Generalised Planck law.

## Convolution issue

Please refer to this [document](./doc/240718_analytical_convolution.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the mathematical problem and a possible solution.

## Examples

In the `examples` folder there is a jupyter-lab notebook with a simple example where we fit some data with the new component.
